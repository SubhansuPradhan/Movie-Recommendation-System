# Movie Recommendation System

A Python-based movie recommendation system implemented by Subhansu Pradhan. The project likely utilizes movie datasets and recommendation techniques to suggest movies—details are available in the notebook.

##  Project Structure

```
SubhansuPradhan/Movie-Recommendation-System
├── Recomendation_System.ipynb   – Jupyter notebook illustrating the recommendation workflow
└── movie.py                     – Python script containing core logic (e.g., data loading, model, recommendation function)
```

##  Features (to update based on your actual implementation)

- Data loading and preprocessing from movie datasets (e.g., MovieLens)
- Calculation of similarity (e.g., correlation, cosine similarity)
- Generating recommendations based on user input or predefined logic
- Possibly outputs recommended movie titles or rankings

##  Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (for `.ipynb`)
- Required Python libraries (e.g., `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, etc.)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SubhansuPradhan/Movie-Recommendation-System.git
   cd Movie-Recommendation-System
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**  
   *(If you have a `requirements.txt`, use it; otherwise install commonly used ones.)*
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn jupyter
   ```

### Usage

#### Option 1: Via Jupyter Notebook
```bash
jupyter notebook Recomendation_System.ipynb
```
- Walk through the steps in the notebook.
- Observe data loading, preprocessing, similarity calculation, and recommendation outputs.

#### Option 2: Via Python Script
```bash
python movie.py
```
- Ensure any dataset paths or configuration inside `movie.py` are correctly set.
- Run to get recommended movies printed to the console (if that's the intended output).

##  Expected Output

- Recommended list of movies based on similarity metrics or input.
- Example outputs are available in the Jupyter notebook—please review.

##  Customize & Extend

- **Datasets**: Update or specify your own movie dataset.
- **Algorithm**: Adjust similarity metrics—cosine, Pearson, etc.
- **Interactive input**: Modify `movie.py` to accept user input (e.g., "Enter movie title:").
- **Improve UI**: Consider building a minimal web interface (e.g., using Streamlit or Flask).
